    <h2>Biography & Early Beginnings</h2>
    <p>
      My name is <strong>Amanuel Dawit (AMAN)</strong>, and I am a young electronic music producer and DJ born and raised in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. I started making music at 14 years old, producing on a friend’s laptop because I didn’t have one of my own. When I saved enough money, I bought my first laptop—an Acer with only 28 GB of hard disk space and 500 MB of RAM. Though it was far from powerful, I managed to create remixes of 90s-era songs. Becoming a music remixer was never my plan, so I kept these remixes private.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over time, I continued developing my skills, learning from local DJs and producers, as well as drawing inspiration from major international artists. This journey led me to become a full-time music producer with a style of my own. I started reaching out to established industry figures and rising musicians alike, which helped me build a network and collaborate on my first official music projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      During my childhood, I experimented with rap music using online samples. Later, I met a friend named Kaleb Moges who introduced me to the EDM genre. Initially, music was just a hobby, but as I discovered my talent and the potential to make a positive impact, I decided to pursue it full-time. I find inspiration in many genres, and I especially love creating music at night when I’m in the ideal mood.

    <h2>Achievements & Musical Growth</h2>
    <p>
      One of my major milestones was the release of my first official music track, <em>"Kal"</em>, in June 2021. This track gained over 7 million views on YouTube and was nominated for the Addis Music Award in the categories of <strong>Best Music of the Year</strong> and <strong>Best New Artist of the Year</strong>. That was the moment I realized I had the potential to become one of the industry’s best musicians.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next came my collaboration with <em>Chacha Sami</em> on a song called <em>"Anemogn"</em>, which merges house music with Ethiopia’s six/eight rhythm. I also released <em>"Kalabay"</em> featuring talented newcomers Biruk and Lina. This track generated significant buzz and introduced a fresh Ethiopian future bass style. I’m now actively working with various mainstream and well-known artists across Ethiopia and Africa.
    </p>

    <h2>Music Genre & Style</h2>
    <p>
      I compose music across a wide variety of genres, often featuring <strong>traditional instrumentation</strong>, and emphasize <strong>innovation</strong>, <strong>exploration</strong>, and <strong>improvisation</strong>. 
      My creative process involves simplicity, high-quality production (from recording to mastering), and the fusion of sounds rarely experienced in the industry.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my view, I'm not just a music producer but an artist—I incorporate elements of professionalism, playful experimentation with sounds, and fearless creativity into my compositions.

    <h2>Long-Term Goals & Aspirations</h2>
    <p>
      My ambition is to gain broad recognition and success through releasing albums (starting with <em>Tigat</em>), EPs, and building a loyal fan base. As I grow, I aim to push the boundaries of my creativity—experimenting with fresh styles, themes, and techniques to express my vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here are some of my key objectives:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Host numerous concerts, with many of my released tracks becoming influential hits</li>
      <li>Establish a recording label and sign different talented singers</li>
      <li>Collaborate globally, performing in diverse cities across Ethiopia and overseas</li>
      <li>Appear in suitable media outlets as a positive example and mentor for emerging artists</li>
      <li>Achieve local, continental (e.g., AFRIMA), and even Grammy-level awards</li>
      <li>Honor my role model, Avicii, by someday visiting his tribute museum in Stockholm</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I intend to use my platform and my art to communicate vital messages, raise awareness about social issues, and inspire upcoming musicians—showing them that one can start with next to nothing and still achieve greatness.
